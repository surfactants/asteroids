# asteroids
prototype scifi roguelite.
 
compiled with GCC 11.2, using SFML 2.5.1 and the C amalgamation of SQLite 3.38.0.

features:

  *  tile-based procgen rooms
  *  animated sprites
  *  data-driven design (database loading done using [json-to-sqlite](surfactants/json-to-sqlite))
  *  that's really it so far, but i'm slowly changing that :)
